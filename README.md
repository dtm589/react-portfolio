# My React Portfolio

## Description
This is my personal React Full Stack Developer portfolio. It showcases my projects, my background, and resume. I decided to utilize React Bootstrap to style my page because I had never used it before and wanted to challenge myself. I also used emailjs/browser to make my contact me section have real functionality.
